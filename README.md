gephi-plugins-label_propagation
===============================

A gephi plugin that provides an implementation of the label propagation graph clustering algorithm described in : Raghavan, U. N., Albert, R., & Kumara, S. (2007). Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks. Physical Review E, 76(3), 036106.
The plugin supports annimated propagation of cluster labels over node for educational purpose.
The current implementation lacks defensive/offensive label propagation support (1) which improves the performance of the clustering process.
